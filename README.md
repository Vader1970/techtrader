# App Development Summative - Tech Trader

## Project Introduction

Our objective for this formative is to work as a team to build an application that is intuitive to use and displays data from an API in an easily understandable representation. Before implementation, the application will be modeled and prototypes will be tested. The implementation of the project will be managed using agile methodologies. All contributed code will adhere to the teamâ€™s best practices. Project dependencies will be managed and the application will be built for production.

Our project proposal should adhere to Yoobee Best Practices, and in particular, it must include:

- research, comparison and justification of technical options, such as framework, libraries, plugins and third-party services
- models of the application using Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams
- usability testing results
- research to ensure that the API can fulfil the identified use cases (if using an external API)
- an explanation of the main project dependencies
- a Javascript Best Practices document for the chosen Javascript framework or library and a Javascript Style Guide

Other projects requirements include:

- That the application will be developed using an industry-standard Javascript framework or library
- That Prototypes will be created to test usability and results will be documented
- Data for the project will be retrieved from an API
- Project dependencies will be managed by a package manager and the project will be built for production

Module 3 - App Design
Diploma in Web and UX Design (Level 6) | 30 credits | v1.0
You must demonstrate competency in all learning outcomes to successfully complete this assessment.

Overview
Your task is to contribute to the build of an application that is intuitive to use and displays data from an API in an easily understandable representation.

Before implementation, the application will be modelled, and prototypes will be tested. The implementation of the project will be managed using agile methodologies. All contributed code will adhere to best practices. Project dependencies will be managed, and the application will be built for production.

General requirements
Your proposal should adhere to Yoobee Best Practices, and in particular it must include:
research, comparison, and justification of technical options, such as framework, libraries, plugins and third-party services
models of the application using Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams
usability testing results
research to ensure that the API can fulfil the identified use cases (if using an external API)
an explanation of the main project dependencies
a JavaScript Best Practices document for the chosen JavaScript framework or library and a JavaScript Style Guide
The application will be developed using an industry-standard JavaScript framework or library.
Prototypes will be created to test usability and results will be documented
Data for the project will be retrieved from an API.
Project dependencies will be managed by a package manager and the project will be built for production.
Project requirements
An individual grade will be given to each student. Each student will individually document and submit evidence of all the requirements specified in the brief.
The development (with code attribution) and project management are collaborative.
You will be required to communicate with peers to organise into teams for this project.
The project will be stored on a remote repository, and you must either set up and manage the repository and invite contributors, or you must contribute to a remote repository set up by a peer. Code will not be included until it meets quality standards in the team's JavaScript Best Practices document
You will be responsible for attributing your own work according to best practices. Code that has not been attributed will not be marked.
During development, you are required to complete a blog entry to record agile processes. Each entry must list what you did the previous day, what you will do that day, and any barriers for progress. You are required to participate in daily 'stand-up' meetings.
You will contribute to the project using a collaborative project management tool to follow an agile development process to produce deliverables on time.
It is the team's responsibility to manage the project. If a member is not meeting team expectations, leadership, collaboration, and project management skills should be used to solve the problem.
*All work must be morally and ethically acceptable.

Hand in
Documentation, including a record of agile development processes and participation in group work, and JavaScript best practices style guide documentation.
Web project with node_modules folder removed.
Hand-in files are zipped together and uploaded to the submission point.
Project scenarios
In each of the following scenarios, the client would like to make the code for the project available to the open source community, and in doing so, requires the project to be built without errors.

Choose one scenario from below:

Sharing app
An increasing number of event management companies are choosing to enable attendees and speakers/special guests to engage with each other through social platforms.

An event management company is interested in creating a custom platform that can be tailored to suit a conference they are about to run. Attendees will be able to share ideas, experiences, ask questions, and pose problems. Speakers will be able to respond to attendees with answers and solutions content posted through the platform will be projected in public spaces at the event.

They require attendees and speakers to be able to log in, post content in the form of text and/or images, and comment on or reply to posts from other attendees.

An interface is required that enables attendees and speakers to post (and reply to) content. A full-screen display interface that can run unattended for projecting the content is also required.

The solution requires the user to: create an item, view a list, view item details, update or edit the item and delete an item.

Community-minded space
ZIP (Zero Invasive Predators Ltd) was established in February 2015 as a research and development entity focused on developing the tools and techniques to enable an ambitious and exciting vision for New Zealand: The complete removal of rats, stoats, and possums from large mainland areas for the long term, sustainable protection of native biodiversity.

To help communities engage with this vision ZIP would like to develop an app that enables users to photograph wildlife in their area and receive feedback from community members. Images and feedback are intended to be publicly available on a website and displayed in an engaging way on screens at the ZIP offices.

An interface is required that enables users to post (and reply to) content. A full-screen display interface that can run unattended for displaying the content on screens is also required.

The solution requires the user to: create an item, view a list, view item details, update or edit the item and delete an item.

Niche market app
C2C (consumer to consumer) platforms match buyers with sellers, this type of e-commerce is made up of online classifieds or forums where individuals can buy and sell their goods.

Your client wants to create C2C market space for their users to buy and sell their products (types of products or product category can be decided by you). The seller should be able to post a product with its associated details, buyers should be able to view, leave comments and ask questions about the product/s.

The solution requires the user to: create an item, view a list, view item details, update or edit the item and delete an item.

*Ideas for goods; gaming/tech items, craft, sports equipment, cars, clothing etc.

UML is done very well well. Excellent Work here.
Can see excellent engagement via Githhub, Trello and MS teams. Excellent Group engagement here.
Excellent Depth here, great work discussing all frameworks and justifying why you have consumed these frameworks. MongoDB was an excellent selection and aligns with your overall requirements and supporting the overall architecture.
APIs consumed are excellent, all were justified.
Research depth is excellent and great work discussing the overall value.
Good Test Strategy developed here - can be a bit more fleshed out in terms of testing specific processes, comparison against competitor and KPI metrics.
Excellent Documentation.
