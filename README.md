# App Development Summative - Tech Trader

## Project Introduction

Our objective for this formative is to work as a team to build an application that is intuitive to use and displays data from an API in an easily understandable representation. Before implementation, the application will be modeled and prototypes will be tested. The implementation of the project will be managed using agile methodologies. All contributed code will adhere to the teamâ€™s best practices. Project dependencies will be managed and the application will be built for production.

Our project proposal should adhere to Yoobee Best Practices, and in particular, it must include:

- research, comparison and justification of technical options, such as framework, libraries, plugins and third-party services
- models of the application using Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams
- usability testing results
- research to ensure that the API can fulfil the identified use cases (if using an external API)
- an explanation of the main project dependencies
- a Javascript Best Practices document for the chosen Javascript framework or library and a Javascript Style Guide

Other projects requirements include:

- That the application will be developed using an industry-standard Javascript framework or library
- That Prototypes will be created to test usability and results will be documented
- Data for the project will be retrieved from an API
- Project dependencies will be managed by a package manager and the project will be built for production
